Add the passive port range `30000-50000` or `30000:50000` to the `TCP_IN` and `TCP_OUT` sections in the CSF configuration.

This will solve the issue.

#### Special Note
Sometimes, enabling the 30000:50000 port doesn't work. In that case, allow the following port range too.

`55000–60000` or `55000:60000`
